# Skin Lesion Classification for Cancer Detection

This academic project utilizes Deep Learning (CNN) to detect skin cancer from dermatoscopy images using the HAM10000 dataset.

## Project Highlights
- **Model Architecture:** MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning).
- **Accuracy:** ~95% Training, ~89% Validation.
- **Dataset:** HAM10000 (Human Against Machine).
- **Technique:** Used `GlobalAveragePooling`, `Dropout`, and `Class Balancing` to reduce overfitting.

## How to Run
